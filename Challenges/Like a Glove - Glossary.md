**Glove**: an unsupervised algorithm used by AI. GloVe learns word meaning from global statistics of word co-occurrence. GloVe (global vector) algorithm is used to obtain vector representations of words. It is used to find similarities between word based on words that appear together in text.

**Global statistics**: looks at the _entire text collection_ (all sentences) and counts how often words appear together anywhere.

**Embedding**: Turning something (like a word) into a set of numbers (a vector) that captures its meaning and relationships with other words.

**Semantic relationships:** are the **meaning-based connections between words**.  
It’s about how words are related in terms of **meaning**, not just spelling or sound.

**Word2Vec**: learns word meaning from local neighborhoods of words. Word2Vec slides a “window” across sentences and learns patterns from these **small chunks of text**.

**Local Neighborhoods**: the few words before and after a word.
