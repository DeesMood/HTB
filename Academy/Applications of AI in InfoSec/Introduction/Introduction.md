Throughout this process, you will gain experience with the end-to-end workflow of `AI` development, from exploring datasets to training and testing models.

You will construct three distinct `AI` models in this module:

1. A `Spam Classifier` to determine whether an SMS message is `spam` or not.
2. A `Network Anomaly Detection Model` designed to identify abnormal or potentially malicious network traffic.
3. A `Malware Classifier` using `byteplots`, which are visual representations of binary data.
