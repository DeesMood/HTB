To evaluate your model, upload it to the evaluation portal running on the Playground VM. If you are not currently using the Playground VM, you can initialize it at the bottom of the page.

If you have the Playground VM running, you can use this Python script to upload your model from Jupyter directly. Once evaluated, if your model meets the required performance criteria, you will receive a flag value. This flag can be used to answer the question or verify the modelâ€™s success.

```python
import requests
import json

# Define the URL of the API endpoint
url = "http://localhost:8000/api/upload"

# Path to the model file you want to upload
model_file_path = "spam_detection_model.joblib"

# Open the file in binary mode and send the POST request
with open(model_file_path, "rb") as model_file:
    files = {"model": model_file}
    response = requests.post(url, files=files)

# Pretty print the response from the server
print(json.dumps(response.json(), indent=4))
```
