To evaluate your model, upload it to the evaluation portal running on the Playground VM. If you are not currently using the Playground VM, you can initialize it at the bottom of the page.
```python
import requests
import json

# Define the URL of the API endpoint
url = "http://localhost:8002/api/upload"

# Path to the model file you want to upload
model_file_path = "malware_classifier.pth"

# Open the file in binary mode and send the POST request
with open(model_file_path, "rb") as model_file:
    files = {"model": model_file}
    response = requests.post(url, files=files)

# Pretty print the response from the server
print(json.dumps(response.json(), indent=4))
```
