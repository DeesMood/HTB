Malware is software designed to cause damage or unauthorized actions on a computer system or network. Malware can be categorized based on its characteristics, mode of operation, and purpose, among other factors. A malware category is commonly referred to as a `malware family`. We can look at [malpedia](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/families) to explore details about different malware families. Famous examples include [Emotet](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.emotet) and [WannaCry](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.wannacryptor).

In this section, we will implement a malware classifier based on the technique explored in [this](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.16108) paper, which explores malware classification based on malware images.

## Malware Image Classification

While classifying malware based on images might initially sound counterintuitive, we will explore the dataset in the upcoming section and learn why this approach makes sense.
